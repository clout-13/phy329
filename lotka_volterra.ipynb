    "## The Lotka-Volterra model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lotka-Volterra model is a simple model of predator-prey interactions in a complex ecosystem. It is given by a system of coupled differential equations,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\frac{dn_i(t)}{dt} = n_i(t) \\left( r_i + \\sum_{j=1}^N A_{ij} n_j(t)  - d_i n_i(t)\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n_i(t)$ is the number of individuals of species $i$ at time $t$, $r_i > 0$ is the intrinsic population growth rate of species $i$, $d_i > 0$ is a population-limitation constant such as overcrowding or resource scarcity, that prevents species $i$ from continuing to grow in number indefinitely. The term $A_{ij}$ is the interaction coefficient between species $i$ and $j$. The matrix $A$ is assumed to be traceless ($A_{ii}=0$ for all $i$), because the terms $r_i$ and $d_i$ cover the self-terms already. If $A_{ij} > 0$, then species $i$ benefits from the presence of species $j$, such as through symbiotic interactions, and if $A_{ij} < 0$, then species $i$ is harmed by the presence of species $j$, such as by predation. If $A_{ij} = 0$, then species $i$ and $j$ do not directly interact, though they may indirectly interact through other species. The total number of species is given by $N$, and so we have $N$ equations, one for each species.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A single species\n",
    "\n",
    "We can understand the behavior of Eq. (1) by first considering the case where $N=1$, in which case the dynamics become a one-dimensional ordinary differential equation,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\frac{dn_1}{dt} = n_1 \\left( r_1 - d_{1} n_1 \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We may recognize that this equation defines sigmoidal growth dynamics, with exact solution given by the logistic growth curve,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    n_1(t) = e^{r_1 t} \\frac{n_1(0)}{r + n_1(0)(e^{r_1 t} - 1) d_1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When $n_1$ or $d$ are small, the population grows exponentially. However, at long times, the overcrowding term, $d_1$ causes the population density to reach an asymptote $N_\\text{max} = r_1/d_1$, known in ecology as the *carrying capacity* of the population. The logistic growth curve is sometimes reparameterized in terms of this parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predator-prey dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "Another well-known specific case of Eq. 1 is predator-prey dynamics when $N=2$. In this case, the model is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\frac{dn_1}{dt} = -n_1 \\left( r_1 + A_{12} n_2 \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\frac{dn_2}{dt} = n_2 \\left( r_2 - A_{21} n_1  \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the specific case of predator-prey interactions, we set the signs and assume all of the parameters $r_i$, $A_{ij}$ are positive. Notice that $n_1$, the predator, has a negative growth rate, and so it decreases in population in the absence of prey. However, by encountering and eating the prey (the cross-term), it can increase its population. Conversely, $n_2$ describes the prey, which can graze or forage to increase its population in the absence of predators ($r_2 > 0$). However, interactions with the predator reduce the prey population. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the interactions are balanced, the predator and prey populations will oscillate: the prey population initially increases, which causes the predator population to increase with a delay. However, as the predator population increases, it will consume more prey, which causes the prey population to decrease. This, in turn, causes the predator population to decrease, and the cycle repeats. These dynamics have previously been observed in real ecosystems containing few species, such as [the dynamics of lynxes and hares in the Canadian wilderness.](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~azinger/mat127-spr22/PredatorPreySystems.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random ecosystems\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we expect for the dynamics of the predator-prey model in the limit of large ecosystems ($N \\to \\infty$)? Experimentally, each term in the species interaction matrix $A_{ij}$ requires isolating a pair of species, and measuring how they interact. Additionally, measuring the intrinsic growth and saturation rates $r_i$, $d_i$ requires an additional set of $N$ isolation experiments, for a total of $N(N+1)$ total experiments in order to pin down the values of every parameter in Eq. 1. This may be feasible in the case of lynxes and hares, but it becomes more fraught for systems like the gut microbiome ($N \\sim 10^3$ species) or a coral reef ($N \\sim 10^6$ species).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the spirit of May's work, we are therefore going to study the behavior of Eq. 1 when all of the parameters are drawn from random distributions: $r_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$, $A_{ij} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. Physically, that means that we assume an ecosystem with a roughly equal number of mutualistic and antagonistic interactions, and we assume that equal numbers of species grow or die out in isolation, much like the lynxes and hares. Importantly, the interactions $A$ can be *non-reciprocal*: the effect of species $i$ in the growth rate of species $j$ may not be the same as the effect of species $j$ in the growth rate of species $i$, and so $A_{ij} \\neq A_{ji}$ in general (the predator prey case above is a good example of a strongly non-reciprocal system.

Implicit methods allow larger timesteps or more accurate updates, by inverting the Jacobian (a locally linear approximation of the dynamics) at each timestep. Recall that, for a system of ODEs, the Jacobian is given by the matrix of partial derivatives of the right-hand side of the equations with respect to the each of the state variables. Calculate the analytic jacobian of the Lotka-Volterra model, and then use it to implement an implicit method.
